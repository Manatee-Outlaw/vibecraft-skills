description: >
  Run a full 8-check engineering audit of your codebase via Claude Code.
  Catches database association errors, undefined variables, token limits, silent
  failures, auth gaps, missing routes, dead code, and git hygiene issues. Trigger
  immediately when the user says "engineering review", "code audit", "run audit",
  "bug hunt", or "check the codebase". For an in-chat audit without Claude Code,
  use holistic-code-audit instead. For the full comprehensive audit,
  use comprehensive-audit.

# Engineering Review

Runs 8 targeted checks against the live codebase using Claude Code. Produces a
prioritized findings report grouped by severity. Does not fix anything — report only.

**This skill vs holistic-code-audit:**
- holistic-code-audit: runs in this chat, interactive, good for a quick pass or
  when Claude Code isn't available
- engineering-review: runs via Claude Code task.md, deeper automated checks,
  takes 10-15 minutes, better for pre-release audits

## Triggers
`engineering review` / `code audit` / `run audit` / `bug hunt` / `check the codebase` / `audit the code`

## Execution — Run All Steps in Order

### Step 1 — Create task.md

Use bash_tool to write `/mnt/user-data/outputs/task.md` with this exact content:

```
Perform a full engineering review of this codebase. Read <server-file>, <frontend-file>, <report-generator>, and <shared-module> before starting. Then run every check below and produce a prioritized findings report.

CHECK 1 - Database Association Audit

Read the actual schema by running:

python3 -c "
import os; [os.environ.setdefault(k.strip(),v.strip()) for line in open('.env') for k,_,v in [line.strip().partition('=')] if line.strip() and not line.startswith('#')]
from your_shared_db_module import get_db
with get_db() as conn:
    tables = [t[0] for t in conn.execute(\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\").fetchall()]
    print('TABLES:', tables)
    for t in tables:
        cols = [c[1] for c in conn.execute(f'PRAGMA table_info({t})').fetchall()]
        print(f'{t}: {cols}')
"

Then scan every SQL query in <server-file> and <report-generator>. Flag any query referencing a table or column not in the actual schema.

CHECK 2 - Undefined Variable References

Scan <server-file> for every variable used in a function that is not defined in scope, not a parameter, and not a module-level constant. Pay special attention to constants used in route handlers.

CHECK 3 - API Token Limits

Find every Claude API call. Check whether max_tokens is sufficient for the JSON structure expected. Flag any where the response schema could realistically exceed the limit.

CHECK 4 - Silent Failure Patterns

Find every empty error handler in JavaScript and bare except with no logging in Python. Flag each one noting whether intentionally silenced or a genuine gap.

CHECK 5 - Auth Pattern Consistency

Find every fetch() call in <frontend-file> hitting an @require_auth endpoint. Verify each includes Authorization Bearer header. Flag any using credentials:'include' or missing auth entirely.

Also find every endpoint gated by <scoped-token>. Verify the overlay pages pass ?token= correctly.

CHECK 6 - Frontend to Backend Route Verification

Find every fetch('/api/...') in the frontend. Verify the @app.route exists in <server-file> with correct HTTP method. Flag any pointing to missing or wrong-method routes.

CHECK 7 - Dead Code

Find functions defined but never called, routes unreachable, JS functions with no callers, and orphaned code blocks after return statements.

CHECK 8 - Git Hygiene

Run: git status
Run: git ls-files -s *.sh | grep -v 100755
Flag untracked files that should be committed or added to .gitignore.
Flag any .sh file with mode 100644 (non-executable) as CRITICAL.

---

Output Format - group by severity:

CRITICAL - Will cause production errors (wrong table/column, undefined variable, broken route, non-executable cron script)
WARNING - May cause errors under specific conditions (token limits, silent failures, missing auth)
NOTE - Code quality issues that will not break things

For each finding: file, line number, what is wrong, one-sentence fix.

Do not fix anything. Save report as engineering-review-[today's date].md and present it.
```

---

### Step 2 — Present task.md for download

Present the file and tell the user:

> "Save this to `<projects-dir>\<your-repo>\task.md`, then in Claude Code type:
> `read task.md and execute all the checks`
>
> This will take 5-10 minutes. Paste the report back here when done."

---

### Step 3 — Interpret the report

When the user pastes back the findings:

1. Review all CRITICAL items — these need fixing before any other work
2. Review WARNING items — flag any that match known failure patterns from this project:
   - Wrong table/column names (hit multiple times)
   - Missing auth headers on fetch calls
   - Token limits too low for response schemas
   - Undefined module-level constants
   - .sh scripts with 100644 mode (cron silent failure)
3. Group fixes by file so Claude Code can handle them in batches
4. Recommend which items to fix now vs defer

Present a plain-English summary of findings before diving into individual fixes.
Ask the user which items to tackle first.

---

## Hard Rules

- Never skip Step 3 — the report is only useful if interpreted, not just delivered
- Always check if any CRITICAL items match active user-reported bugs before prioritizing
- Do not start fixing until the user confirms which items to address
- After fixes: trigger push-to-git to deploy
- For a faster in-chat audit without Claude Code, use holistic-code-audit
