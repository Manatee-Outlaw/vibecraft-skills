name: skill-library-audit
description: >
  Audit the entire skill library to find gaps, overlaps, stale content, and
  improvement opportunities. Use this skill whenever the user asks to "audit
  our skills", "check the skill library", "what skills are we missing",
  "do a gap analysis on our skills", or "review our skills". Also trigger
  proactively after any major project sprint where new workflows emerged that
  aren't yet captured as skills — if the user just finished a large build
  session and asks "what are we missing?", this is the right skill. The goal
  is to make the skill library a living, accurate reflection of how work
  actually gets done.

# Skill Library Audit

A skill for auditing the skill library itself — finding what's missing,
what's stale, what overlaps, and what's never used.

---

## Step 0 — Load the full skill library from Drive

Before doing any analysis, read every skill file from the Drive skills
folder. Do not rely on skills already in context — the full library
must be explicitly loaded to audit it completely.

The engineering skills folder ID is: <drive-folder-id>
The Claude Skills folder root ID is: <drive-folder-id>

Steps:
1. Search the root skills folder and all subfolders for every .md file
2. Download and read each SKILL.md in full
3. Also check for any bundle files (engineering.md, enterprise.md,
   creative.md) that list which skills are active — these tell you
   which skills are actually loaded vs. just stored
4. Build a complete inventory before proceeding to Step 1

If a skill file cannot be read, flag it as UNREADABLE and continue.
An unreadable skill is itself a finding.

Use the Google Drive MCP tools: search_files with parentId filtering,
then download_file_content for each file found.

---

## Step 1 — Inventory the skill library

From the files loaded in Step 0, record for each skill:
- Name (from frontmatter)
- Description (the triggering text, from frontmatter)
- What it claims to do (from body)
- Whether it's in an active bundle or standalone
- Whether it's general-purpose or project-specific

Organize into categories:
- Engineering / code quality skills
- Operations / infrastructure skills
- Business / workflow skills
- Meta skills (skills about skills)
- Project-specific skills

Report the full inventory before doing any analysis.

---

## Step 2 — Gap analysis

A gap is a workflow that happens repeatedly but no skill covers it.

Sources for gap detection:
1. **Recent conversation history** — what tasks came up repeatedly that
   required improvisation? Any time Claude had to figure something out
   from scratch that could have been a skill, that's a gap candidate.
2. **Audit findings** — did a recent audit (engineering, security, etc.)
   surface a check that wasn't in any skill? Example: execute permission
   checks on cron-called scripts — found in production but missing from
   the production-drift skill until it caused a real failure.
3. **Recurring fixes** — bugs that were fixed multiple times suggest a
   skill should capture the pattern.
4. **Handoff friction** — anything that required significant re-explanation
   at the start of a new session is a skill gap.
5. **Skills that reference each other** — if skill A frequently leads to
   skill B, there may be a missing skill that combines them.

For each gap identified:
- Name the missing skill
- Describe what it would do
- Give an example trigger phrase
- Rate impact: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Note whether it's project-specific or general-purpose

---

## Step 3 — Staleness check

A skill is stale when its content references outdated tools, APIs,
versions, patterns, or workflows.

Check each skill for:
- Version numbers (plugin versions, library versions) that may have changed
- API endpoints or field names that have been updated
- Tool names that have been renamed or replaced
- Workflow steps that have been superseded
- Project-specific constants (table names, file paths, config keys) that
  have drifted from reality
- Documentation claims that contradict current known behavior
- Expected counts (e.g. "8 cron jobs" when there are now 12) that have
  grown stale as the project evolved

Flag each as:
- STALE: Content is demonstrably wrong based on current knowledge
- LIKELY STALE: References specifics that may have changed
- REVIEW NEEDED: Hasn't been touched in a long time, may drift

---

## Step 4 — Overlap detection

Two skills overlap when they cover similar territory and a user might
not know which to use, or Claude might load both unnecessarily.

Check for:
- Skills with similar trigger phrases
- Skills that accomplish the same goal via different approaches
- Skills where one is a subset of another (consolidation candidate)
- Skills that should reference each other but don't

For each overlap:
- Name both skills
- Describe the overlap
- Recommend: CONSOLIDATE / KEEP SEPARATE WITH CLEARER TRIGGERS / ADD CROSS-REFERENCE

---

## Step 5 — Trigger quality check

A skill with a poorly written trigger description either never fires
(undertriggering) or fires when it shouldn't (overtriggering).

For each skill, evaluate:
- Does the description clearly state WHEN to use it?
- Does it include example phrases a user would naturally say?
- Is it specific enough to not trigger on unrelated requests?
- Is it "pushy" enough? Skills tend to undertrigger — descriptions
  should actively encourage use in relevant situations.
- Does it accurately describe what the skill produces?

Flag:
- UNDERTRIGGER RISK: Description is too vague or passive
- OVERTRIGGER RISK: Description so broad it might fire inappropriately
- MISMATCH: Description doesn't match what the skill actually does

---

## Step 6 — Completeness check

A complete skill has:
- Clear inputs (what does the user provide?)
- Clear outputs (what does the skill produce?)
- A success criterion (how do you know it worked?)
- Error handling (what if something goes wrong?)
- At least one example or test case

For each skill, flag any missing components.

---

## Step 7 — Generate recommendations

Produce a prioritized action list:

### IMMEDIATE (fix this session)
Skills with critical gaps or staleness that are actively causing problems.

### HIGH PRIORITY (fix next session)
Gaps in frequently-used workflows. Skills stale in ways that could
cause incorrect behavior.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (fix within a few sessions)
Trigger improvements, overlap consolidation, completeness gaps.

### LOW PRIORITY (nice to have)
Minor improvements, rarely-used skills, polish.

For each new skill recommended, include:
- Suggested name
- One-sentence description
- What gap it fills
- Example trigger phrase

## Notes on project-specific vs. general skills

Some skills are general-purpose (work on any project). Others are
project-specific (reference file paths, table names, API keys).
When auditing:

- General skills should stay generic — flag any project-specific
  hardcoding that crept in
- Project-specific skills should be clearly labeled as such
- If a project-specific skill describes a pattern useful across projects,
  recommend extracting a general version

## Notes on the execute permission gap (real example)

In June 2026, a production failure revealed that run_reports.sh had
mode 100644 (non-executable) in git. Cron fired on schedule, got
"Permission denied", wrote nothing to logs, and no alert fired.
12 days of silent report failures. The production-drift skill existed
but didn't check execute permissions.

This is the canonical example of a skill gap: a real failure pattern
that should have been caught by an existing skill but wasn't because
the skill's scope was too narrow. When doing the gap analysis, look
for similar "the skill existed but missed this" patterns.

The fix: production-drift.md now includes Step 4 (Execute Permission
Audit) as a general-purpose check for any project using cron.
