# Mobile UX Review

Streamers live on their phones. They check their dashboard between streams.
They read reports while commuting. They submit check-ins from wherever they
are. The desktop experience is the test environment — the mobile
experience is where the product actually gets used.

## Context: How Streamers Use the App on Mobile

Before reviewing anything, understand the mobile use cases:
- **Pre-stream:** checking current goals, reviewing playbook tasks for tonight
- **Post-stream:** submitting a check-in, quickly seeing if revenue updated
- **On the go:** reading weekly/monthly reports, checking the diagnostic
- **Rare on mobile:** the manager view, bulk export data, Discord settings,
  the coaching overlay (`<host-app>` only — desktop)

The review should weight the pre/post-stream flows most heavily — these are
where mobile matters most.

## The 8 Mobile Checks

### CHECK 1 — Touch Target Size
*Can a streamer tap everything reliably with their thumb?*

The minimum reliable touch target is 44×44 pixels. Anything smaller causes
mis-taps — especially when used quickly before/after a stream.

Scan the frontend code for:
- Small buttons (look for `btn-sm` class — are these used for primary actions?)
- Icon-only buttons (the icon itself must be 44px, not the text it represents)
- Items in lists or tables (streamer rows, report cards) — are the tap targets
  the full row or just a small chip?
- Nav tab buttons — are these wide enough to tap confidently?

Flag any primary action button that appears to be below the 44px threshold.

### CHECK 2 — Typography and Readability
*Can a streamer read everything without zooming?*

Check the font sizes used in the frontend CSS variables:
- Body text should be at minimum 14px (16px preferred)
- Secondary/label text (`sm` class) — what size is this? Below 12px on mobile
  is unreadable
- Diagnostic output text — this is long-form coaching copy. Is it readable
  at mobile width?
- Report cards — are numbers and key metrics large enough to read at a glance?

Also check: does the layout allow iOS/Android browsers to auto-zoom into text
fields when they're tapped? (This happens when font size is below 16px in
inputs — it's disorienting.)

### CHECK 3 — Navigation on Small Screens
*Can a streamer navigate the app comfortably on a phone?*

Check the nav bar:
- Enumerate the app's top-level tabs — on a 375px screen, do they all fit?
- Do any tab labels get truncated?
- Is the active tab clearly distinguishable from inactive ones at small size?
- Is there a horizontal scroll on the nav that a user might not discover?

Check any nested sub-navigation:
- Where a top-level tab has its own sub-tabs, enumerate them — do these work
  on mobile?

### CHECK 4 — Scroll Behaviour
*Does everything scroll correctly without trapping or losing the user?*

Check:
- Are there any fixed/sticky elements that eat into the usable screen space
  on mobile? (The nav bar being fixed at top reduces visible content)
- Are there any modal dialogs or overlays — do they scroll correctly on mobile?
  (The diagnostic flow, the hard-delete confirmation modal)
- Are there any tables or wide content areas that overflow horizontally
  without proper handling? (Streamer rosters, bulk export data tables)
- Does the check-in form work on mobile? (Text areas, dropdowns)

### CHECK 5 — The Core Mobile Flows
*Do the highest-priority mobile flows work end-to-end?*

**Flow A — Post-stream check-in (most frequent mobile action):**
1. Open app on phone
2. Navigate to check-in
3. Fill in streams, revenue, priority action, blocking note
4. Submit
5. See confirmation

Walk through this flow in the code. Flag any step that has a small touch
target, unclear input, or confusing state.

**Flow B — Reading a weekly report (regular mobile use):**
1. Open app on phone
2. Navigate to dashboard or reports
3. Find and open latest weekly report
4. Read the full coaching content

Check: is the report readable at mobile width? Do long sections collapse or
require horizontal scrolling?

**Flow C — Checking the diagnostic result (occasional):**
1. Open app on phone
2. Navigate to Diagnose tab
3. Read the full diagnostic output

Check: does the diagnostic output reflow for mobile? Can a streamer read the
full coaching narrative without awkward line breaks or overflow?

### CHECK 6 — Forms on Mobile
*Do inputs work well with a mobile keyboard?*

Find every form in the app (check-in, diagnostic questionnaire, settings,
onboarding intake). Check:
- Do number inputs use `type="number"` or `inputmode="numeric"` to trigger
  the number keyboard?
- Do text areas for long-form input resize correctly as the user types on mobile?
- When the keyboard appears, does it cover important UI (submit button, field labels)?
- Are placeholder texts large enough to read before the user taps into a field?

### CHECK 7 — Performance on Mobile Networks
*Does the app feel fast enough on a phone connection?*

Look for:
- Are there any large assets (images, PDFs) loaded inline that would be slow
  on mobile data?
- Are API calls made one at a time (waterfall) that could be parallelized?
- Is the single-file SPA (`<frontend-file>`) unusually large?
  Check its file size — above 500KB is worth flagging for mobile.
- Are reports and PDFs loaded lazily (only when requested) or eagerly?

### CHECK 8 — Offline / Connection Loss Handling
*What happens when a streamer loses connection mid-action?*

Streamers stream from locations with variable connectivity. Check:
- If the connection drops while submitting a check-in, does the form data get
  lost or does the UI hold it?
- Is there any feedback when an API call fails due to network loss?
- Does the SPA give any indication if the connection is lost and data isn't saving?

## Reporting Format

For each finding, include:
- **Screen / Flow:** where this occurs
- **The problem:** what the streamer experiences on mobile
- **Severity:** Critical (breaks the flow), Friction (makes it harder), Polish
- **Suggested fix:** what change would address it

End with a **Mobile Readiness Score** — a plain-English summary:
- Which flows work well on mobile today?
- Which flows are usable but uncomfortable?
- Which flows need real work before a mobile-primary user could rely on them?
